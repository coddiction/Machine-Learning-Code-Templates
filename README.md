# Machine-Learning-Code-Templates
Code Templates for faster ML
In this you will get the most efficient code templates for your future Machine Learning Projects.
So, that you can build your future Machine Learning Projects within Flash light, that means being a Data Science one, you only need to focus and spend time on taking out insights else not to just building and writing code for a particular model.
You just need to change the name of your dataset.
